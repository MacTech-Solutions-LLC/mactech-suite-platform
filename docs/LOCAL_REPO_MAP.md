## Per-Repo Source Locations

### Hub (`mactech-suite-platform`)

## Key Rules

1. **Hub is source of truth** for identity, orgs, roles, entitlements, audit, and app registry. Never build local authority tables in satellite apps.
2. **Do Hub work from `C:\MacTech-Suite-repos\mactech-suite-platform`** — it tracks origin/main.
3. **Do Opp/Pricing/Proposal work from `C:\Users\MacTech_Git`** — Phase B branches are active there.
4. **No production deployments without Brian approval** — not by agents, not by CI, not unilaterally.
5. **`AGENTS.md` in every repo** must bind `DR-2026-06-10-01` and `DR-2026-06-10-02`.
6. **`/api/health` and `/api/build-info`** are required on every app for Command Center health monitoring.
